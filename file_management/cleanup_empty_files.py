# âœ… Goal:
# Scan a directory recursively and delete all empty files.
# - A file is considered empty if its size is 0 bytes.
# - Log each deletion to the console.
# - Print a summary at the end showing how many files were removed.

# Validate input

# Recursively scan files
for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
    for filename in files:
